<p>
In your country, license plates are issued in a unique alphabetical order. 
It started with the first car receiving the plate <tt>a</tt>, the second <tt>b</tt>, and so on until <tt>z</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Once they reached <tt>z</tt>, they began issuing plates like <tt>aa</tt>, <tt>ab</tt>, ..., and so forth, continuing alphabetically just like counting in base-26 with lowercase letters.
</p>
<p>
The sequence follows this logic: after <tt>z</tt> comes <tt>aa</tt>, then <tt>ab</tt>, and eventually <tt>az</tt>, <tt>ba</tt>, ..., until <tt>zz</tt>, after which the system continues to <tt>aaa</tt>, and so on.
</p>
<p>
