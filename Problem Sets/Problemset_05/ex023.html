<p>There’s a collection of race cars, and each car requires a minimum skill level to drive.
You also have a group of drivers, each with their own skill level.

</p><p>Your goal is to determine, for each driver, the most difficult (i.e. highest skill-requirement) car they are able to drive.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Task</a>
</h2>

<p>You are given a sorted list of integers representing the skill levels required to drive each car in the collection.
You are also given a list of integers representing the skill level of each driver.

</p><p>For each driver, find the car with the highest skill requirement that they can still drive.
If a driver can't drive any car, the answer is <tt>0</tt>.

</p><h2>
Input
</h2>

<ul>
<li>The first line contains an integer <tt>n</tt> (<tt>1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000</tt>) — the number of cars.

</li><li>The second line contains <tt>n</tt> integers in increasing order (each between 1 and 1,000,000,000), representing the required skill for each car.

</li><li>The third line contains an integer <tt>m</tt> (<tt>1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000</tt>) — the number of drivers.

</li><li>The fourth line contains <tt>m</tt> integers (each between 1 and
1,000,000,000), representing the skill level of each driver.
</li></ul>

<h2>
Ouput
</h2>

Print one line with <tt>m</tt> integers separated by spaces.
For each driver, print the skill requirement of the hardest car they
can drive (i.e. with highest skill).
If a driver can’t drive any car, print 0 instead.

Output</a>
</h3>

<pre>0 3 5 6
</pre>

<h3>
Explanation
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first driver has a skill level of 1. The easiest car requires
  3, so this driver can't drive any car. Thus the output is 0.

</li><li>The second driver has a skill level of 4. They can only drive the
  car that requires 3. Thus the output is 3

</li><li>The third driver has a skill level of 5. He can drive cars that
  require 3 and 5. The hardest is 5. Thus the output is 5

</li><li>The fourth driver has a skill level of 7. He can drive all cars in
the list (3, 5, and 6). The hardest is 6. The output is 6
